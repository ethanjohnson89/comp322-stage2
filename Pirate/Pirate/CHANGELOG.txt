Changelog for "Pirate" project


NO! CORRECTION**************
To merge into Dropbox, do NOT copy files into the dropbox project. The dropbox needs to remain a flawless, working copy of the project. If you want to merge into dbox, copy the dropbox project into a temporary local location on your machine, then copy the lines from your changes into THAT local project, then only after ensuring that it works can you then put it in the dropbox folder. To put it in the dropbox folder, DELETE what is currently in the dropbox (ensure no one else has edited it since you started your merge) and paste in the local copy that has your merged changes in it.

Best practice: 
	-send out an "I'm merging" email so no one else will attempt a merge at the same time as you.
	-Don't run Pirate from the Dropbox solution. It will create the ipch directory as well as the sdf file, taking up unnecessary dropbox space.

2013-10-28 4:00 PM - James
	Added debugMode (activatable from in-game) : type scdebugmode to turn it on, "scdebugmode off" to turn it off
		This is useful because now in the code we can wrap debugging outputs in (if player.isdebugMode()) and it
		will only display if, when in game, the player first types scdebugmode

	Gameplay changes and balances
	Refactored (Changed getVesselByName and getVesselById to one overloaded "getVessel(*)" function. Same for getArea)

	Added a basic randoms engine
		make random event functions in randomEvents.cpp, use pointers to those to create RandomEvents in globals.cpp

	(note: "#pragma once;" at the beginning of a file makes it only be included once) 

2013-10-25 7:00 PM - Nick
	Type "areas" to see the areas you have previously been to.
		this is stored in the player class as a set of integers (area id)
		added corresponding functions for printing the list of areas, discovering an area 
		compatible with save / load

2013-10-25 2:50 PM - Nick
	Added WisePrint - replacement for cout that doesn't cut off words between lines
		replaced almost every instance of cout to wout

	Added "useful commands" to the help function (Access with "help")
	Corrected a vessel capacity bug

2013-10-23 4:30 PM - Nick
	re-did fishing wait delay (Player::GetWaitTime())
